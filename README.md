# No-Hit-Challenge
 a modlet for "no hit" challenge players

 ## INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The download .zip file contains a folder called `\Mods`. You can either:

1. Copy this folder into your game directory, usually `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\7 Days To Die`
2. Copy the folder into `%AppData%\Roaming\7DaysToDie`

### What it does ...
When this modlet is installed, it will cause any enemy to be able to kill your player with one hit.

All other damage should work as normal.

### Changes
Added 2 kill counters, one for kills since last death, and one for kills total.

Removed kill counters and death counters as they're inaccurate and need reworking

Added back fully functional kill counters and death counter.
